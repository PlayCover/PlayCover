<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to PlayCover! This software is all about allowing you to run apps & games on your M1 device running macOS 12.0 or newer.

It does this by putting the applications through a wrapper which imitates an iPad. This allows the apps to perform very well and run natively because the M1 chip is essentially a glorified mobile chip. Another advantage to the software is that you can insert and manipulate custom controls with your keyboard, which is not possible in alternative sideloading methods such as Sideloadly. These controls include all the essentials, from WASD, Camera movement, Left and Right clicks, and individual keymapping, similar to a popular Android emulator‚Äôs keymapping system called Bluestacks.

This software was originally designed to run Genshin Impact on your M1 device, but it can now run a wide range of applications. However, not all games are supported, and there may be bugs in games.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Following the installation instructions will get Genshin Impact you up and running in no time. The steps can be repeated if you want to try out other games or apps.

### Prerequisites

At the moment, PlayCover can only be installed and executed on M1 MacBooks. Devices with the following chips are supported:

* M1
* M1 Pro
* M1 Max
* M1 Ultra

 Unfortunately it cannot run on any Intel chips, so you are forced to use Bootcamp or other emulators.

### Homebrew Cask
We host a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap with the [PlayCover cask](https://github.com/PlayCover/homebrew-playcover/blob/master/Casks/playcover-community.rb). To install from it:

1. Tap `PlayCover/playcover` with `brew tap PlayCover/playcover`;
2. Install PlayCover with `brew install --cask playcover-community`.

To uninstall:
1. Remove PlayCover using `brew uninstall --cask playcover-community`;
2. Untap `PlayCover/playcover` with `brew untap PlayCover/playcover`.


### Build from Source

You will need:

- [Carthage](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/carthage)
- Xcode
- An Apple ID

Just clone this project, open it in Xcode.

You have to codesign it with your Apple ID in Xcode,
just follow the instructions.

### Extra Installation Steps For Genshin Impact

1. Disable SIP
    - This can be done by shutting down your mac, holding down power button
    - After this, click on your username/ssd, then keep going until you can see `Utilities` at the top
    - When you see this, click on it and click on `Terminal`
    - After this, you should be in a terminal window
    - Type `csrutil disable` in that terminal window
    - Put your password and everything, then restart your mac

2. Modify nvram boot-args
    - When you have SIP disabled, type the following:
        - `Command + Space`, type `Terminal` in the search box
    - It should open a normal terminal window
    - Type the following in this window (or copy paste it)
        - `sudo nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"`
    - If it appears that nothing has happened, this is correct.
    - Now restart your mac once again

3. Login to Genshin
    - Open Genshin Impact with PlayCover, and you should be greeted with a Login button
    - Login to your account, then wait until the door appears and quit the game with `Command + Q`. **DO NOT CLICK/ENTER THE DOOR.**
    - Thats all which is required in Genshin for now

4. Enable SIP
    - Shut down your mac again
    - Hold down the power button until you get to recovery options
    - Click on your username and your storage disk respectively like you did for step 1.
    - You should see `Utilities` at the top

    - In terminal, type the following: `csrutil enable`
        - `csrutil clear` should also work
